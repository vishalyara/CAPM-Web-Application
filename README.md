This project provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard where users can select multiple stocks, fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance, and analyze their performance relative to the market. It computes daily returns, estimates Beta (β) and Alpha (α) values, and applies the CAPM formula to calculate expected returns. The app also includes interactive Plotly visualizations of stock price trends and normalized performance, along with tabular outputs showing stock data, calculated betas, and CAPM-based expected returns.
